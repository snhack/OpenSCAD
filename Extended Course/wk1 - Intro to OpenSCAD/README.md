## wk1 - Intro to OpenSCAD

**Goal:** Able to model a basic part (e.g. Raspberry Pi Sled) and export it as an STL file for printing.

### Agenda and Example Code

Each agenda item is linked to the associated code example:

* Interface
* [2D Shapes - Circle, Square](2dshapes.scad)
* [Transformations - Translate, Rotate, Mirror](transformations.scad)
* [Booleans - Union, Difference, Intersection](booleans.scad)
* [Hull](hull.scad)
* [Extrusion - linear_extrude](extrusion.scad)
* [Variables](variables.scad)
* [Loops - For](loops.scad)
* [3D Shapes - Sphere, Cube, Cylinder](3dshapes.scad)
* [Modules](modules.scad)
* Layout and coding best practises
* Finish your part
* Export as STL
